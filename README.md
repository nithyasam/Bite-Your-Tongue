# Bite-Your-Tongue

Bite Your Tongue is an app that takes the frustration out of being angry (or hangry, if thatâ€™s your issue). The app functions as a voice to text angry letter writer. The basic flow is to simply speak into the app, submit your angry voice recording, then provide links to outside food services to feed your fury. After a certain amount of time, the app will email your angry letter to you, giving you the option to then send it to the recipient of your anger. 

The motivation for its development was simply to provide an immediate solution to frustration and anger, as well as suggestions of tools to make you happy, or at least, less potentially homicidal. After a little patience and food, no situation is truly that bad. This gives you the chance to review the words spoken in anger before you send them so that you can have the option to change your mind.
